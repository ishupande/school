     <p>With the gradual improvements in many aspects in the school from 2006 to 2020, many things have fallen in line with the system. In the beginning in 2006, class 9th and 10th was introduced with around sixty students. Students had to go to other schools for Intermediate after passing the high school. In 2010, the school got affiliated to intermediate as well in the Arts stream. Later in 2014, feeling a need, middle school classes were also introduced viz. 6th, 7th and 8th.</p>
      
      <p>So we offer education from class 6th to 12th now and the number of students which was around 60 has gone up to 750 now with the increase in the infrastructure and better facilities, most of the students being girls. The people living in the nearby area are now sending their children to school for education who earlier used to ask the children to help in  farming. Science and Home Science is also now being proposed to be introduced in intermediate.</p>
