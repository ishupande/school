 <p>With the increase in the number of students over the years, there is a need of additional toilets to be built for the increasing students every year. There are two hand pumps out of which one is in working condition and a proposal for installing a submersible pump is initiated. In 2010, Four hundred students were studying in the school which has increased to Seven hundres fifty in 2016. The interesting fact here is out of 750 students, 550 are girls and most of them are from SC, OBC and Muslim community, so it can be clearly concluded that the school is full filling the very purpose for which it came into existence that is helping in the education of economically most backward classes of society, specially the girl child of such communities.

Every section is happy about the education. The location of the school was chosen keeping in mind the safety of the girls and all the students feel safe and secure in school. Though things are being done but a lot more needs to be done for a good education of these children for which sadly there are limited funds. There is a need to build the administrative block in the school. A total of 19 rooms are there now, 13 in 2010 and 6 were made gradually thereafter. Fees had to be increased to Rs. 100 and Rs. 120 for classes 10th and 12th respectively as there were not enough funds for paying the salary of teachers. The school got affiliated to 6th, 7th and 8th in the year 2014 so the school is now running from class 6th to class 12th.</p>
